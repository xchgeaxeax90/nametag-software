* Datasheets and application notes:
  - AVR16DD20 Datasheet: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU08/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/AVR32-16DD20-14-Complete-DataSheet-DS40002413.pdf
  - Getting started with TCA Technical Brief: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU08/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/TB3217-Getting-Started-with-TCA-DS90003217.pdf
    - This will be used to drive the 6 PWM channels controlling the
      lights on the face. Two sets of lights (the eyes and top l/r)
      are shared and will be multiplexed
  - Getting started with TCB Technical Brief: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/TB3214-Getting-Started-with-TCB-90003214A.pdf
    - This timer (of which there are two) will be used to generate a
      periodic interrupt to switch between the eye and top l/r multiplexing
  - Getting started with TCD Technical Brief: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU08/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/TB3212-Getting-Started-with-TCD-DS90003212.pdf
    - This timer will be used to generate the PWM signals for the penlights
  - Getting started with RTC Technical Brief: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/TB3213-Getting-Started-with-RTC-DS90003213B.pdf
    - This may or may not be used to trigger a PWM setting update -
      Either this, the second timer B, or an extra counter and hook
      into the multiplex interrupt will do it
  - Getting started with CCL Technical Brief: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/TB3218-Getting-Started-with-CCL-90003218A.pdf
    - This might be needed to debounce/filter the signal from the
      button (which conveniently is on a CCL input, totally by accident)
